# Pingpong Words

I saw someone on twitter write about how typing the word 'skepticism' is like
playing ping pong with your keyboard (in that every letter alternates hands when typing).

I thought this was really funny and wondered how the person found this word.

My goal was then to find the biggest word that worked like this.

## How to run the program

Simply run the executable with one argument, the path to a text file with valid characters
separated by new lines.
The output will be a list of all of the longest words with this Ping Pong property.

If you are on a mac, you can test this program with `/usr/share/dict/words`.
